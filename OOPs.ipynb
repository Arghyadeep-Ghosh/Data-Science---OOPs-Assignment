        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class.\n",
        "It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which helps protect the integrity of the data and prevents unauthorized or accidental modifications.\n",
        "Encapsulation is achieved using access specifiers like private, protected, and public.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on hiding the complex implementation details of an object and exposing only the necessary parts through a simplified interface.\n",
        "It helps in managing complexity by allowing the user to interact with the object without knowing its internal workings.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class (child or subclass) can inherit the properties and methods of another class (parent or superclass).\n",
        "This promotes code reuse, establishes a relationship between classes, and enables the creation of a hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
        "It enables a single interface to represent different underlying data types. The most common example of polymorphism is method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific\n",
        "implementation of a method declared in its superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Association (Including Aggregation and Composition): Association refers to the relationship between objects. It can be of various types, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Aggregation: A \"has-a\" relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent (e.g., a university and its students).\n",
